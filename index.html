        <p class="lead mb-4">There are many qualities that I have that would make me a great worker. I am very responsible when it comes to arriving to work on time or doing tasks. I am also a very team-oriented person meaning that I work very well with a team. Another quality that I have is that I work very well under pressure. I am good at managing my time and making sure that everything is done when it is supposed to be. I am a very communicative person. Whenever there is a problem or I need help, I make sure to communicate with my peers to make sure that everything is figured out and that everybody is on the same page. Customer service is my top priority. I feel as a worker, it is my job to make sure that the customer leaves happy with their experience.  I know that these qualities make me a strong and very good worker.<br><br>

        Currently, I am a student at the University of California Riverside. I am a Business Administration major. I chose to major in Business because I had a business of my own about two years ago. I independently created a clothing brand and sold the products online. I contacted nearby screen printers to help print the graphics onto each shirt and sweater. Once it kicked off, I began to take pictures and advertise the products on social media. I knew that a younger demographic of people would be interested in my brand, so they were my main target. I worked really hard in creating this, and I couldn't wait to see where things would go. Soon enough, I started receiving orders. I would ship, package, and deliver every order personally. It was a lot of work, but it was all worth it to me in the end. This experience gave me a little bit of insight on what it is like to own a business, and it ultimately influenced me to become a business major.<br><br>

        Some past experience that I have is working at Ten Ren's Tea Time. I was a server/barista there and I was in charge of many things. I was in charge of making drinks, serving food, and ensuring that the customers left satisfied. I worked with a POS system and handled money. This job gave me experience with customer service, handling food, and handling money. I also used to have a seasonal job as a basketball coach. I coached children in seventh to eighth grade. As a coach, I would hold practices where we practiced plans and worked on different aspects of teamwork. Since we were in a league, we played games against other teams and I was in charge of making sure the team was playing correctly and called the correct plays in different situations. Having this experience taught me how to be a good leader.
